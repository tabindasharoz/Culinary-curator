        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        
        <p>
            Our mission is to promote cooking at home while making it more efficient, more affordable, and less wasteful.

        </p>

        <h1>About foodcombo</h1>
        <p>Cooking at home has been linked with eating healthier, but lack of time, financial constraints, a shortage of inspiration, and/or insufficient cooking knowledge can all be obstacles.

            We created foodcombo to tackle and minimize some of the challenges of cooking at home because deciding what to cook for your next meal can and should be simpler than what it is.
            
            Just plug in an ingredient you have on hand in your kitchen or what you would like to eat, and we’ll provide you the recipes that adapt to your pantry rather than the other way around.
            
            Complete a food profile, and foodcombo will personalize your recipe searches according to your food and diet preferences to ensure you only get recipes you can and want to eat.
            
            For those that are comfortable in the kitchen and like to improvise, we suggest flavor pairings for your selected ingredient. Sort of like giving you access to a personal chef.
            
            Our ingredients-driven approach also enables users to take advantage of locally produced, in-season, or on-sale ingredients and reduce food waste.
            
            Home cooking can support a healthy lifestyle, so let’s make it more enjoyable or, if you’re one of those people who find it draining, then at least less burdensome.</p>

            <h1>Our values</h1>
            <p>Meals bring us closer to our families, friends, and colleagues; therefore, we believe meals should be shared.

                We emphasize ingredients first and foremost because we believe they are central to our environmental and personal wellbeing and our customs and cultures.
                
                Community is important to us. We support eating local and seasonal whenever possible.
                
                We strongly believe everyone has a right to access fresh fruits and vegetables.
                
                We believe food should be valued and not wasted.
                
                We believe eating real ingredients has true health advantages.
                
                We do not believe that one diet fits all. Dietary requirements vary from person to person, so rather than take a position on what is best for you, we leave that up to you, your nutritionist, and/or doctor.
                
                Above all, we believe that eating well benefits the body and nourishes the soul.</p>
